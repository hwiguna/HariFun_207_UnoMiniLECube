Arduino Uno Mini LED Cube
[] Better Pillar Jig
[] No more I/O pins
[] Does the built-in LED remain off?
[] Measure current usage. Layer Transistor unnecessary?
[] MsTimer2
[] Write more effects
[] Start working on PCB? Hmm, pending transistor.

Lesson learned:
- Setting output pillar pins as inputs to make the float did not work.
I suspect switching pinMode takes too long that it interferes with the interrupt timing.


Kicad screw ups
- I put everything on top copper, when actually I want the top to be black and everything soldered on bottom.
- Kicad now has tools to move things from layer to another, but I still had to deal with all the wiring
When wire is moved from back to front it mirrors!
- But good news is I discovered Kicad's new curved rats nest. That's awesome! You can see the connections much easier.
- There's not much room, so I decided not to add transistors.
- Had to change plan to use pins nearby rather than numerical sequenced
- Will need to retest using different IO Pin for common layer grounding.
- For gold to show up, it must have mask. Thanks to Kicad's 3D, or I would not have discovered this mistake.
- Overlaps trigger DRC (Design Requirement Checks): Courtyard, silk clipped by mask.

KiCad improvements since last time I used it:
- No more export import net list
- Keep dropping same part
- Curved rats nest

Kicad Cool things:
- 3D really helped me catch mistakes (backward layer, texts, missing mask
- Curved rats nest REALLY help visualizing connections before tracks are laid down

Rewire breadboard cube and alter code.

[Intro]
The Arduino Uno Mini LE came out at the end of 2021. At $50 each, it is not cheap, so I decided not to get one.

I don't know what posessed me, but I a few weeks ago I decided to buy one.
Actually, I also got another one for you. More about that later.

You've probably seen pictures of this Uno mini limited edition.
But it's not until I held it in my own hands, I realized how tiny it is.
So tiny that the headers are half the size of standard Arduinos.

Other than it's size, it really is an Arduino Uno. Same ATmega328P as the Uno, same clock speed, same I/O pins.
It uses a USB C connector instead of USB Micro, so that's a step up.

So, once I got it, it was kinda of a let down.
Um, yeah, so I got another Arduino. Very adorable and all, but now what?!

I don't know about you, but most of my project ideas stems from playing.
So, I just started playing with it.  Blinking, reading analog port, multiplexing.
That's when I realize that the Uno Mini just like the Uno has EXACTLY the number of I/O pins to directly
control a 4x4x4 LED cube.



I discovered some cool things while playing.  For instance, these headers are so close to each other that it is
impossible to plug two jumper wires next to each other.
But they must've already thought of that and they've made the female headers on the Uno Mini to be DOUBLE SIDED!
I've never seen anything like it.
You need a small diameter jumper wire to poke from the other side.  Not all my jumpers fit from the other side.
I think it just depends on the batch of jumper wire.
